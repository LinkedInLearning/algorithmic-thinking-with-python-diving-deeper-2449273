The need for competent problem solvers has never been greater, and Python has become an important programming language. Because of its clarity and expressiveness, Python is an ideal tool to explore algorithmic thinking. In this course, Robin Andrews explains algorithmic thinking and guides you through puzzles, problems, and theories to help you build and challenge your skills. After a warmup problem, Robin shows you how to use the divide and conquer problem solving technique and the Quicksort algorithm, with puzzles to practice each. He dives into the transform and conquer technique that applies preprocessing to the data for a problem before implementing a solution, with additional puzzles for practice. Robin goes over dynamic programming, both top-down and bottom-up, and gives you problems to practice both theory and implementation. Plus, he introduces and explains hash tables and how you can use them to solve problems in Python.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
